Python Fundamental :
=============================

Indentation & whitespace :

Every line in python should start from a common line. If there is a block, then the line inside the block should start with a whitespace.

Comments : 

There are two types comments.

1) Single-line #
2) Multiline ''' '''/ """ """

When a line or more lines are commented, then interpreter ignores or skips them.


Identifiers :

Any name/word used for variable, function, class and module is called identifiers

rules :
1) must contain a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _
2) must not start with a digit
3) must not be too lengthy. (meaningful and short)
4) must not use a keyword as identifiers
5) Case-sensitive 

cash$ = 10  #invalid
name = "Aptech"  #valid
_hi = 90 #valid
s#s = 'sos' #invalid 
for = 10 #invalid
For = 10 #valid


Keywords :  

reserved words / 35

A = 10
a = 20


Statements : 

Statement is an instruction to interpreter/computer. So in python, every line is a statement.

In a python program, there may be group of statements.

A statement is a combination of identifiers, operators, keywords, values etc.

e.g. 

for I in range(10):
   print(I)




Variables : variable is an identifier which stores a value.

e.g. name = 'Aptech'
     name = "Learning"

The variable always hold the latest value assigned to it.

Rules for declaring a variable : 

The rules for Identifiers are also applicable for variable.

1) variable must contain a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _

2) variable must not start with a digit

3) variable is case sensitive

4) variable name can not be a keyword

example : 

name = "Aptech"

* Single variable with a single value

name = "Aptech"

a = 10

z = 1.234

* Multiple variable with multiple values in a single line

name, a, z = "Aptech", 10, 1.234

note : the no. variables in left must be same no of values in right

* Multiple values in a single variable

fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]

[a, b , c] = fruits

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

note : It is called unpacking values from a variable


Why python is considered as dynamic typed programming language ?

When we assign a value to a variable, variable type automatically converted to the type of value assigned.
This happens while we are running program. Hence it is called dynamic typed.


In programming scope context, variable are two types

1) local variable
2) global variable

A vaiable declared within a block is local to that block and it can not be accessed outside.

A variable declared with global scope can be accessed anywhere.


Example :  

a = 20
def welcome():
   a = 10
   print(a)

welcome()
print(a)
 
#=================
a = 20
def welcome():
   global a
   a = 10
   print(a)

welcome()
print(a)

#=========================================================
