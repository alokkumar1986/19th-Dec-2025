Python Fundamental :
=============================

Indentation & whitespace :

Every line in python should start from a common line. If there is a block, then the line inside the block should start with a whitespace.

Comments : 

There are two types comments.

1) Single-line #
2) Multiline ''' '''/ """ """

When a line or more lines are commented, then interpreter ignores or skips them.

3) must not be too lengthy. (meaningful and short)
4) must not use a keyword as identifiers
5) Case-sensitive 

cash$ = 10  #invalid
name = "Aptech"  #valid
_hi = 90 #valid
s#s = 'sos' #invalid 

A = 10
a = 20
