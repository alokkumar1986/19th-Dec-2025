String datatype :

Anything that is enclosed with a single quote or double quote is considered as string.

e.g.

a = 'aptech'

b = "APTECH"

print("Aptech")

print(type(a)) #<class 'str'>
print(type(b)) #<class 'str'>

Quote within another quote :
=============================

a = 'Ram's House'

b = "Aliva"s brother"

Here both string are invalid, because we can not use single quote (') within another single quote (').
And also we can not use double quote (") within  another doble quote (")

a = 'Ram"s House'

b = "Aliva's brother"

Here both are valid now.


multiline string :
=======================

For assigning a multiline string to a varibale, we generally use  '''/ """.

e.g.

a = '''We are Learning Python Programming. 
It is a part of Data Science Course.'''

b = """We are Learning Python Programming. 
It is a part of Data Science Course."""

print(a)
print(b)


Escape Characters :
======================

These are use to format a string in the output.

\b  : back space
\r  : carriage return
\t  : horizontal tab
\'  : single quote
\"  : doble quote
\/  : backward slash


a = "Apte\bch"
print(a)

b = "Apte\rch"
print(b)  #chte

c = "Ap\ttech"
print(c)  #Ap tech


String Length :
===================

a = "Aptech"
b = "Learning"

print(len(a))
print(len(b))


Part of string :
===================

a = "Aptech Learning"
b = 'tech'

print(b in a)   #True


Loop in String :
=========================

a = "Aptech Learning"

for i in a:
 print(i) 

for i in a:
 print(i, end ="")  #Aptech Learning


String Slicing : 
============================================

Slicing means cutting into several pieces. 

In string slicing means getting a part of the string. 

syntax : 

string[start:stop:step]

here start : starting index
stop : stop index
step : jump value either adding or substracting (by default 1)

stop index is not considered.

s = "Aptech"
print(s[1:4]) #pte

In a string, we can access each character using index and index starts from 0.

s = "Aptech"
print(s[0]) #A
print(s[len(s)-2]) #c
print(s[2]) #t
print(s[6]) #error string index out of range


slicing to get all element : 

s = 'Aptech'
print(s[0:6]) #Aptech

s = 'Aptech'
print(s[0:])  #Aptech

s = "Aptech"
print(s[:6])  #Aptech

s = "Aptech"
print(s[:])  #Aptech

Negative Indexing : 
========================

s = "Aptech"
print(s[-1]) #h
print(s[-2]) #c

print(s[-7]) #error string index out of range


Slicing using negative indexing :
======================================

s = "Aptech"

print(s[-3:-1]) #ec

print(s[:-1]) #Aptec

print(s[-6:]) #Aptech

#Write a program to print the string in reverse order using slicing ?

s = "Aptech"
# Reverse the string using slicing
reversed_s = s[::-1]
print(reversed_s)

Modify a String :
#======================
lower() : to make string in lowercase
upper() : to make string in uppercase
strip() : to remove whitespace from beginning and end of the string
split() : to divide the string into multiple pieces based on a character/string 


s = 'Aptech'
print(s.lower()) #aptech
print(s.upper()) #APTECH


s = '            Aptech       '
print(s.strip()) #Aptech


s = 'We are learning python fundamentals'
s1 = s.split("")
print(s1)

#write a program to find number of words in a string.

s = 'We are learning python fundamentals'
s1 = s.split("")
print(len(s1))


concatenation of strings : 
==============================
a = 'Aptech'
b = 'Learning'
c = a+" "+b
print(c)

String Format : 
=================================
a = "Aptech"
b = "we are learning python in "+a
print(b)


a = "Aptech"
b = f"we are learning python in {a}"
print(b)


# Write a program to get following output from the string :  Aptech Learning

1) aptecH learninG

2) APTECh LEARNINg
