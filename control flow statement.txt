if statement :


syntax : 

if condition:
 statement1
 statement2
 statement3
statement4


Here from Indentation, we know statement1, statement2, statement3 are inside if block
statement4 is outside of the if block


Here condition == True, statement1, statement2, statement3 will execute
     condition == False, statement1, statement2, statement3 will not execute

But statement4 will be executed either condition is True/ False


Example :  Write a program to enter your name, If name is Ram, the print Hello Ram.

name = input("Enter your name : ")
if name == "Ram" :
  print("Hello", name)


if else statement:

syntax :

if condition:
  statement1
  statement2
else:
  statement3
  statement4
statement5

Here statement1, statement2 are inside if block
     statement3, statement4 are inside else block
     statement5 is outside of if else block

then condition == True, statement1, statement2 will execute 
     condition == False, statement3, statement4 will execute

statement5 will be executed either condition is True or False.


Example : Write a program to enter your name, If name is Ram, the print Hello Ram otherwise print Hello Guest.


name = input("Enter your name : ")

if name == 'Ram':
  print("Hello",  name)
else:
  print("Hello Guest")


if elif ... else statement :


syntax :

if condition1:
  statement1
elif conditon2:
  statement2
elif condition3:
  statement3
else:
  statement4

Here 

statement1 will execute, when condition1 is True, rest will be skipped
statement2 will execute, when condition2 is True & condition1 is False, rest will be skipped
statement3 will execute, when condition3 is True & condition1, condition2 are False, rest will be skipped

statement4 will execute, when condition1, condition2, condition3 are False

Example :

Write a program and enter your mark secured in Python. Find your Grade

mark >= 30, mark < 50 , Grade = C
mark >= 50 mark < 70 , Grade = B
mark >= 70, Grade = A

mark <30 , Fail

mark = int(input("Enter your mark in Python (1-100) : "))

if mark >= 30 and mark < 50: 
  print("Grade : C")
elif mark >= 50 and mark < 70: 
  print("Grade : B")
elif mark >= 70 : 
  print("Grade : A")
else:
  print("Fail")
